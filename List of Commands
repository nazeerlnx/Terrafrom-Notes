$ terraform init    -> it considers the provider

$ terrafrom plan > content.txt    -> it shows what and all the changes takes in the cloud platform

$ terraform apply    -> it creats the instance or executes the code 

$ terraform destroy  -> it terminates the what and all the things create by the form
